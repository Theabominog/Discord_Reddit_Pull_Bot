# Discord_Reddit_Pull_Bot
A basic discord bot that shows a random picture from a subreddit

This is only a basic idea of what i would like to add to the bot. Future updates and improvments that i have in mind are:
1.) Allowing the user to choose the subreddit rather than selecting from a predetermined list
2.) Adding twitter integration where the bot would post hourly updates or tweets from a specified account.
..... And hopefully more stuff as we progress.

Any ideas/feedback would be appreciated.
